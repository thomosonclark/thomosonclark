I'm interested in learning
The crypto market has been unstable people ask themselves if this is the right time to buy the dip or sell their Holdings. before jumping into conclusion I think you should take a look at things first. BTC price fall means analyst remain divided over whether it is entering a bear market or is just suffering a brief correction on the road to more record highs.Investors who bought early are still in profit despite the recent price crash and they also earn by trading. I'm still an investor and still winning by applying the same method in every trade you can also become a winner today. We
should follow the way of earning more regardless of the current market (bulls and
bears), which is trading. Buy the dip and
trade... I have made over $20,000 profits not just buying the dip but implementing trades with signals supplied by Mrs Mary Allen . You can easily get her on<  W_h_a_t_s_a_p_p ±①②②⑨②⑦0④⑥⑨⑤
